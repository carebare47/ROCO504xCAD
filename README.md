# ROCO504xCAD
The CAD files and STLs for ROCO504x

In this repository you will mostly find output STLs and sliced G-CODE. The vast majority of STLs here were generated in Autodesk Fusion 360. Most spool couplers were generated in OpenSCAD, and some preliminary motor couplers were designed in Solidworks.
